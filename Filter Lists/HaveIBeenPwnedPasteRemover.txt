! Description: Do you feel unfairly targeted by relatively non-threatening pastes on Â«Have I Been PwnedÂ»? Perhaps you once used your E-mail address in the actual goddamn E-mail field on 4chan 7 years ago, or you're part of a large E-mail-based DnD group? Or maybe for any other reason? In that case, this list will make Have I Been Pwned largely ignore any paste results for your E-mail address(es).
