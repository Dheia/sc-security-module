! Version: 13December2019v1-Alpha-Compilation
! Description: Most of us who are able to read this description, likely have some old relatives who get very easily confused about even the most basic of PC stuff. This list, if implemented on their PCs alongside uBlock Origin, can help you help them stay more safe from old people's tech mistakes, giving you fewer strange help requests from them as well.
