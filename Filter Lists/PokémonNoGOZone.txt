! Title: ðŸ›€ PokÃ©mon No-GO Zone
! Version: 21January2020v1-Alpha
! Description: Are you desperate to get some quality time with your brother or dad, who is so much into PokÃ©mon GO that they play it to this day while hacking around from the couch? Here's how to get that quality time backâ€¦ unless they just switch to 4G instead, in which case you're screwed. May also work against 'Harry Potter: Wizards Unite' and 'Ingress Prime'
! Note: This list is almost solely intended for AdGuard Home and phone versions of AdGuard. There is no reason whatsoever to use this list on a desktop PC, so I've intentionally made this list not work in any uBlock Origin- or Adblock Plus-based adblockers, nor in PC or browser versions of AdGuard.
