! Title: ðŸŽ® List for removing movies and books from videogame storefronts
! Version: 21April2019v1-Beta
! Expires: 14 days
! Description: While it was admirable that places like GOG, Humble Bundle, and Steam began selling movies and books, their categories for such quickly became a dumping ground for useless indie filler. No one needs three book bundles a month about how to write JavaScript, nor do they need a cashgrab "documentary" about bronies. This list is for those who once again want to reclaim such stores in the name of videogames.
! Note that Steam's selection of non-game software programs is actually pretty high-end and professional, therefore this list does not remove software listings.
