! Title: üèó Remover for Mainstream Tabloid and Alt-Right Sites
! Version: 24February2020v4
! Expires: 10 days
! Description: This list targets international websites that clutter search engine results with misinformation, unfounded articles, and/or contempt for humanity. While designed for use with ¬´Google Hit Hider by Domain¬ª to remove search results, it can also be used with other domains-list tools if you want more thorough blocking of them, incl. AdGuard Home.
! Disclaimer: This is not to be mistaken for an anti-'fake news' list. I gave up the idea of making such a list after seeing that several other such lists couldn't agree on the definition of it.
! For more information, details, helpful tools, and other lists that I've made, visit https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/blob/master/Wiki/General-info.md#english
