! Description: So you're trying to enjoy a new episode of Butterbean's CafÃ©, but you keep bumping into the mouse, which causes the control bar to warp the colours on a third of a screen which ruins the scenic view, and you wait impatiently for the colours to return to normal, which ruins your fun and immersion? If so, this is the perfect list for you.
