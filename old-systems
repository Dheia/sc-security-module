## Examples of old systems

These systems are currently being used more by hackers than real users:

### Example 1

```
Browser => IE 8.0
Platform => Windows 5.1
Full => Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0; MRA 4.3 (build 01218))
```
*Above*: Using a Mozilla 4, IE 8 on a Windows XP is very old and should be flagged.
