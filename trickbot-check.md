## Trickbot Check

You can check for the current version of TrickBot by opening Task Manager and looking for a process named 'Windows Problem Reporting.' If that process is found, click on the 'End Task' button, as shown by the red arrow below, to terminate it.

Now perform a thorough scan of your computer using antivirus software and clean anything that is found.
