# Top 10 Malware Trends of 2019

## 1 Emotet - 36,026 samples

Back in 2014 when it was first identified, Emotet was a promising banking trojan but its operators chose a different path to stay relevant in the cybercrime business.

Delivering other malware through carefully crafted malicious emails is the primary function of this threat these days. A common malware spread this way is TrickBot, a banking trojan with a shifted focus.

## 2 Agent Tesla - 10,324 samples

An info-stealing program available commercially, Agent Tesla became popular among business email compromise (BEC) scammers, who use it to record keystrokes and take screenshots on the infected host.

The malware can also collect information about the system, steal data from the clipboard, and includes routines for killing running analysis processed and antivirus solutions.

## 3 NanoCore - 6,527 samples

This is another tool favored by BEC scammers. NanoCore is a RAT that threat actors have used since 2013. Apart from providing remote access to a victim host, its capabilities also include keylogging, spying, file execution, capturing video and audio, editing the registry, and controlling the mouse.

NanoCore was the RAT of choice for SilverTerrier, a collective name for multiple groups engaged in BEC fraud, who created an average of 125 unique samples per month in 2018.

The developer of NanoCore was arrested in 2017 but its legacy continued through cracked versions that are still in use.

## 4 LokiBot - 5,693 samples

LokiBot emerged on underground forums as an information stealer and keylogger but further development added various capabilities that allow it to evade detection and collect sensitive information.

Looking at a LokiBot sample this year, researchers noticed the following capabilities: anti-analysis, stealing data from at least 25 web browsers, checking for email and web servers running on the machine, looking for credentials in email and file transfer clients.

## 5 Ursnif - 4,185 samples

This banking trojan has been around for some time and has been enriched with new features that kept it in the game.

Ursnif is typically associated with data theft but some variants come with components like backdoors, spyware, or file injection. Deploying other malware, GandCrab ransomware, is another action that researchers observed with this threat.

## 6 FormBook - 3,548

Another info-stealer, FormBook also runs routines to evade antivirus detection. It's been sold on public hacking forums since at least February 2016.

This malware was designed to grab data typed in web forms, regardless of how this is done, even when a virtual keyboard or the autofill function of a password manager was.

Its functions include collecting credentials from web browsers (cookies, passwords), taking screenshots, as well as stealing clipboard content, keylogging, downloading and running executables from the command and control server, and stealing passwords from email clients.

## 7 HawkEye - 3,388 samples

Another keylogger, HawkEye has been in the game since at least 2013, sold by the developer on hacking forums and dark web markets.

It maintains its keystroke interception capability but also provides new functions that allow stealing credentials from various applications and from the clipboard.

Updates for HawkEye are released regularly and advertised as an advanced monitoring solution for systems it runs on, providing data exfiltration functions.

## 8 AZORult - 2,898 samples

Samples of this info-stealer have been observed in the wild since 2016 and available on underground forums for as much as $100. The original version of AZORult is Delphi-based but a newer release emerged this year, written in C++.

Harvesting and exfiltrating data from a compromised system is the main purpose. This covers a wide list, though. From passwords saved in web browsers, email and FTP clients, to cookies, web forms, cryptocurrency wallets, chat history in messaging apps, and files.

## 9 TrickBot - 2,510

Labeled a banking trojan for its original functionality, the TrickBot of today combines many more features than this.

It can enumerate the users on the system, get passwords in web browsers, email and FTP clients, and collect local files from the victim machine.

It is typically delivered through Emotet and can deliver other malware on the system, Ryuk ransomware being one of the notable ones, which is most likely after all useful information has been pilfered.

## 10 njRAT - 2,355

This is another RAT used by the SilverTerrier threat actor. Its history is a long one and starts in 2012 and its use is predominant in the Middle East region.

njRAT capabilities include logging keystrokes, turning on the microphone and web camera on the compromised system. Some samples also have the ability to exfiltrate the title of the current window used by the user.

Most of the malware in Any.Run's top 10 are not new on the scene. On the contrary, some of the samples are almost a decade old, yet they continue to be among the top choices for cybercriminals, proving that old dogs can still learn new tricks and companies should continue defending against known threats.
