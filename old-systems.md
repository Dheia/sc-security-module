## Examples of old systems

These systems are currently being used more by hackers than real users:

### Example 1

```
Browser => IE 8.0
Platform => Windows 5.1
Full => Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0; MRA 4.3 (build 01218))
```
*Above*: Using a Mozilla 4, IE 8 on a Windows XP is very old and should be flagged.

### Example 2

```
 Browser => Firefox 12.0
 Platform => Windows 6.1
 Full => Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:12.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/12.0
 ```
 *Above*: Using a Firefox 12 on a Windows 7
