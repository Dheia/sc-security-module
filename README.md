## Summer CMS Modules :eyes:

**Note: (*) This is the security module, see here for the full list of [Summer CMS Modules](https://github.com/ayumi-cloud/sc-main/blob/main/README.md#summer-cms-modules-).**

## Table of Contents üìë

- [Transparency](#transparency-)







## Transparency üì¢

This project is completely transparent and honest, before we started we contacted and discussed this project with the authors and admins of the October project. We have given the links to this repo to the authors and we continue to be transparent throughout the whole process! We feel it's important to state this and be open from day one! This repo contains one module, of many other modules all dedicated to different sections of the Summer CMS upgrade proposal. Instead of writing ideas and suggestions, we have taken a pro-active approach and are actively coding a fully working solution! The code is held on private repo's, due to the code being heavily developed and changed on a daily basis. We will release a stable test release to the admins and authors in private for feedback before releasing to the general public for beta-testing. This is a long-term project and we will continue to grow!

Over years we have coded and created well over a hundred pull requests (under various github accounts) which have been merged to the October core, we have never asked or recevived any money for any of the pull requests. We use the cms for professional purposes and therefore it is beneficial for our companies to have a professional working solution to give to our end-users and clients. In order for us to delivery a high quality product we made the discussion to update the cms with new and exciting features and modernize old and existing features, there are breaking change!

## Introduction ‚≠ê

The main purpose of the security module is to harden the Summer CMS against a variety of attack vectors. The security module can be broken into the various parts:

- Real-time Server Security Protection.
- Real-time Frontend Firewall (with full dashboards to view all the data).
- Real-time Backtend Firewall (with full dashboards to view all the data).
- Firewall Analytics (displays all the incoming data from the frontend firewall).
- Firewall Custom API's (for full details see: [Summer CMS Firewall API](https://github.com/ayumi-cloud/sc-security-module/tree/master/docs/api) section).
- File Watcher (notifies the webmaster for file changes).
- Plugin Scanner (check plugins for any security issues and code conflicts).
- Malware Scanner (checks the cms core code any security issues and code conflicts).
- Database and CMS Backups (to protect against Ransomware attacks).
- Summer CMS System Infomation.
- Production Mode Checks.
- Firewall Filters.
- Many Security Tools (too many to mention).

### Naming Prefix ‚úíÔ∏è

**Summer CMS uses the `sc-` naming prefix to advoid conflicts.**

## Requirements üö©

**A full list of requirements to install Summer CMS, can be found here: [Summer CMS Requirements](https://github.com/ayumi-cloud/sc-main/blob/main/README.md#requirements-).**

=== TO DO ===

## Machine Learning :computer:

This module uses machine learning to help detect security vulnerabilities.

## Big data üìä

This module uses several Big Data tool sets to analyze large amounts of data collected from various Big Data sources to model various attack methods. Some database sizes are in the petabytes and takes a few hours to run and process some models. These models are then used and tested in our definitions files where we run them in real-time and test them. We also have various non-disclosed test severs running to gather various attacks and add this data into our Big Data models to create either new firewall modules or definition files for the modules. This process helps us to build a more secure security module and helps speed up the build process. We fully rely on using large amounts of data and machine learning tools to process them!

## Deprecations and removals ‚õî

- [Content Security Policy Level 1](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP1/)
- [Content Security Policy Level 2](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP2/)

The legal module has been optimized to work with CSP 3 and allow backwards compatibility with browsers supporting older CSP versions.

- [HTTP Public Key Pinning 'HPKP'](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Public-Key-Pins)

With support now gone in the last remaining browser, HPKP has been consigned to the scrap heap.

- [CSP: report-uri](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/report-uri)

Switched over from using `report-uri` to using both `report-uri` and `report-to`.

## Vendor Packages üß∞

- [Laravel Framework](https://github.com/laravel/framework)

**Installed version**: 6.0 or greater (Summer CMS uses latest LTS version).

- [HTMLPurifier for Laravel](https://github.com/mewebstudio/Purifier)

**Installed version**: 3.0 or greater.

- **Summer CMS Parser**

**Installed version**: 3.0 or greater.

## Installation ‚ù§Ô∏è

Users can setup the security modules security level during installation of Summer CMS, there are two main security levels to choose from during installation:

1. **Normal security level** - this turns off many security settings and allows users to turn on various security settings at a later date (useful for `localhost` and `developer` websites).

2. **Enhanced security level** - this turns on all the security settings (useful for `live` and `production` websites).

All the security settings can be configured at any time in the security module under the `Configuartion` section.

## Firewall Definition Files üíæ

Version: 20200929

Last Updated: 29th Sep 2020

(*) While the security module is under heavy development, the definition files will be updated periodically and not on a regular basis! When the security module moves in a production ready-mode, the definitions files will be updated on a regular basis every week.
  
## Summer CMS Firewall API's üî•

## Troubleshooting üëø

### Something üíä

=== TO DO ===


## Reporting a Vulnerability üí•

We strive to make the code accessible to a wide audience of beginner and experienced users.

We welcome bug reports, false positive alert reports, evasions, usability issues, and suggestions for new detections. Submit these types of non-vulnerability related issues via Github.

Please include your installed version and the relevant portions of your audit log.

False negative or common bypasses should [create an issue](https://github.com/ayumi-cloud/oc-security-module/issues/new) so they can be addressed.

Do this before submitting a vulnerability:

1) Verify that you have the latest version of Summer CMS.
2) Validate which Paranoia Level this bypass applies to. If it works in PL4, please send us an email.
3) If you detected anything that causes unexpected behavior of the engine via manipulation of existing provided rules, please send it by email.

We are happy to work with the community to provide CVE identifiers for any discovered security issues if requested.

If in doubt, feel free to reach out to us!

If you find any bugs in the code or have any improvements in mind then feel free to generate a pull request.

**Note:** Please use Unit Testing and Coding Best Practices in order to have a valid pull request üòâ

Patches and pull requests are encouraged. All code should follow the [PSR-1](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/) and [PSR-2](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/) style guidelines. **Please include unit tests whenever possible!**

## Firewall caching system üåÄ

The security module supports [PSR-6](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-6/) compatible cache adapters for caching results between requests. Using a cache is especially useful, with the firewall being loaded on every page of your website and a user visits multiple pages. During the first visit the headers will be parsed and the result will be cached. Upon further visits, the cached header results will be used, which is much faster than having to parse the headers again and again. While the firewall divides up it's workflow between cached and non-cached tasks.

There are adapters available for other types of caches, such as `APC`, `Doctrine`, `Memcached`, `MongoDB`, `Redis` and many more. The configuration of these adapters all differ from each other, but once configured, all you have to do is pass it as an option when creating the `Parser` object, or use the `setCache()` function to set it afterwards. The security module has been tested to work with the adapters provided by [PHP Cache](http://php-cache.readthedocs.org/en/latest/). For a list of other packages that provide adapters see [Packagist cache-implementation](https://packagist.org/providers/psr/cache-implementation).

## PSR ‚ôªÔ∏è

This security module uses some PSR standards to be the most interoperable possible:

- [PSR-6](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-6/) Caching Interface.
- [PSR-7](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/) Standard interfaces to represent http requests, responses and uris.
- [PSR-17](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-17/) Standard factories to create PSR-7 objects.
- [PSR-18](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-18/) Standard interface to send a http request and return a response.

We also suggest using Cross-browser testing provided by BrowserStack (*) where a real-browser can't be used in-house.

## PHP Coding Standards Fixer ‚≠ï

The PHP Coding Standards Fixer (PHP CS Fixer) tool fixes your code to follow standards; whether you want to follow PHP coding standards as defined in the PSR-1, PSR-2, etc., or other community driven ones like the Symfony one.

### Installation üîπ

The recommended way to install PHP CS Fixer is to use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/) in a dedicated `composer.json` file in your project, for example in the
`tools/php-cs-fixer` directory:

```console
$ mkdir --parents tools/php-cs-fixer
$ composer require --working-dir=tools/php-cs-fixer friendsofphp/php-cs-fixer
```

For more details and other installation methods, see: [PHP-CS-Fixer](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer).

### Usage üî∏

Assuming you installed PHP CS Fixer as instructed above, you can run the following command to fix the files PHP files in the `src` directory:

```console
$ tools/php-cs-fixer/vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix src
```

(*) Change the above command to the correct folder location.

## Semantic Versioning üéÅ

The Summer CMS and all modules use: [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/ayumi-cloud/sc-security-module/blob/master/src/assets/images/semver.png"></p>

Semantic Versioning is a 3-component number in the format of `X.Y.Z` where:

- X stands for a major version.
- Y stands for a minor version.
- Z stands for a patch.

The goal of Semantic Versioning is to bring some sanity to the management of rapidly moving software release targets. As discussed above, 3 numbers i.e, `Major`, `Minor` and `Patch` are required to identify a software version. For example, if we take version `5.12.2`, then it has a `major` version of 5, a `minor` version of 12 and a `patch` version of 2.

Below are some scenarios when Summer CMS creates a new version release:

- Bump the value of X when breaking the existing API.
- Bump the value of Y when implementing new features in a backward-compatible way.
- Bump the value of Z when fixing bugs.

Pre-release metadata is identified by appending a hyphen to the end of the Semantic Versioning sequence. Thus a pre-release for version 1.0.0 could be `1.0.0-alpha.1`. Then if another build is needed, it would become `1.0.0-alpha.2` and so on. Note that names cannot contain leading zeros, but hyphens are allowed in names for pre-release identifiers.

Summer CMS uses the following pre-release metadata:

| Version     | Description        |
| ----------- | ------------------ |
| 3.3.x-aplha | The alpha phase of the release life cycle is the first phase of software testing. |
| 3.3.x-beta  | The beta phase follows after the alpha phase. A Beta phase generally begins when the software is feature complete but likely to contain a number of known or unknown bugs. |
| 3.3.x-rc    | A release candidate (RC), is a beta version with potential to becoming a stable product and is ready to release unless significant bugs emerge. |
